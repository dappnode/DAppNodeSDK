    title: Checkpoint for fast sync
    description: >-
      To get Lighthouse up and running in only a few minutes, you can start Lighthouse from a recent finalized checkpoint state rather than syncing from genesis. This is substantially **faster** and consumes **less resources** than syncing from genesis, while still providing all the same features.  Be sure you are using a trusted node for the fast sync. Check [Lighthouse docs](https://lighthouse-book.sigmaprime.io/checkpoint-sync.html).
      Get your checkpoint sync from [infura](https://infura.io/) (i.e https://XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX@eth2-beacon-prater.infura.io)
